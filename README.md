# HopDaStock
## Proud to announce the release of HopDaStock
This project was a lot of fun to make. I learned so much about swift, python interpretors, embededd systems, and linear regression models. 

### Installation 
#### Download via: (link)

### Features
- Uses AlphaApi to fetch the user defined stocks data, and uses my Linear Regression Model to predict the direction of the stock based on it's previous Open/Close prices
- Error Handling: Added exceptions and spelling checks to ensure that
  - 1. The user defined stock symbol exists
  - 2. We have remaining API calls (I was not paying for a premium API call)
